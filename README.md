# Customer Classification for a Telecommunications Company

## Context
This project aims to develop a classification model to predict customers' interest in a new high-speed telecommunications service.

### Part 1: Perceptron
The perceptron is a supervised learning algorithm that adjusts weights after each training instance to reduce classification error.

### Part 2: Classification Use Case
Automatic classification is essential for targeting marketing campaigns towards customers most likely to be interested in the proposed service.

### Part 3: Logistic Regression
We will use logistic regression to predict interest in the new broadband service, with evaluation based on accuracy, recall, and the ROC curve.

### Part 4: Data Improvement
Analysis of the obtained results and proposal of input data improvements to optimize the model's performance.

## Evaluation
Responses will be evaluated based on clarity, relevance, and accuracy of the calculations performed.
